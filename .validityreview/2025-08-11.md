## PRAGMA General Assembly
- **Quarterly GA Meeting:** Scheduled; agenda to be developed.  

### Value Proposition 1 — Open Source Mentorship
- Frame mentorship as a **long-term community benefit**.
- Recommended opening mentors to outside of PRAGMA members.
- Need for alignment with onboarding (see Phase 2).  
- Need to draft a process for the project committee for review.

### Phase 2 — Onboarding Steps
- Focus on **value-add initiatives**.  
- Creation of a **new committee** within PRAGMA:  
  - Clear governance and accountability.  
  - 1–2 representatives from PRAGMA + additional community members.  
  - Committee to be open and inclusive but may require **active contribution** from members.  
- Drafts needed for onboarding framework and committee rules.

### Value Proposition — Ideas into Goals
- GA-identified value propositions should be **formalized into measurable goals**.  
- Each value proposition to be translated into **2–3 actionable goals**.

## Meeting notes

- **PRAGMA Independent board member status:** Update on the situation with the independent board member of the board, two options were presented: one by Chris from Blink Labs [Chris Aniszczuk](https://www.cncf.io/people/staff/?p=chris-aniszczyk) and [Marek Mahut](https://x.com/stakenuts)  
The first option wasn't pursued, Matthias and Christina reached out to Marek who accepted his role and will be officialised in the next General Assembly of PRAGMA.

- **PRAGMA General Assembly:** another meeting will be held on the 30th of May 16:00 CET to officialise the transition of independent board member and decide on the start of Phase 2 for PRAGMA.

- **Code of conduct review:** the [pull request](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/pull/31) was reviewed and no additional rework has to be done, it can be merged.

- **PRAGMA General Assembly content discussion:** we went through the [minutes of meeting of the General Assembly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAmqSQGMac9StkqMWv5yf1J9Oi3Pl39uBgqmFwpdM3s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.slxgtwqe80fu) focusing on the value proposition of PRAGMA.  
Discussions concluded that overall the proposed ideas sound relevant and interesting, but this will require both resources and organisation to deliver on the ideas put forward during the GA.
- Open Source Mentorship: sounds like a great idea, but a few questions were raised during the discussion:
> Who are the beneficiaries of that service? PRAGMA projects? Incubated projects? Any projects?  
> Who can deliver on that? Who are the mentors ?  
> How is that organised? What resources and time have to be taken into account for this?  
- Field tested documents: looks like an easy quick win to reuse some existing documentation that already worked and rework it to fit a more generic purpose
- Assessment of maturity of an open source project: this can be a liability depending how PRAGMA is positioned on it, this will be looked into by our legal partner to see how we can deliver on that. The idea shared during the meeting by Dan was to have projects make a self assessment of criterias and evaluate themselves on a checklist/maturity check that we will build. 
- PRAGMA ecosystem recommendation: building a list of tools and software that are commonly used in our open source projects can also be a quick win but would require structuring the way the information is given (scope of application, intent, use case description...)  
  The conclusion of the discussion was: anything that PRAGMA wants to provide will have to be evaluated in terms of workload and structure/organisation that needs to exist in order to provide a high quality value proposition.

- **PRAGMA as an Administrator for open source projects:** the [draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Soh3Yr9C70NLh4cRJ9gu16keEBDkbxl-cBA40wAOJkE/edit?tab=t.0) of what PRAGMA as an Administrator means will be studied and given as a minimalistic offer to open source projects  
> A timeline is yet to be communicated on that topic along with clarifying the value proposition, the projects targeted and the pricing.

The sources used for the Administrator role discussion:  

[The cardano Constitution (Article 4)](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/cardano-constitution)
- The administration of such budgets shall utilize, to the extent possible and beneficial, smart contracts and other blockchain based tools to facilitate decision-making and ensure transparency.  
- Any gov action requesting ADA from the treasury must allocate ADA to cover the cost of independent audits and implementation of oversight metrics as to using such ADA  
- Any gov action requesting ADA from the treasury must include dispute resolution provisions.  
- Any ADA from the treasury, held by an administrator must be kept in a separate account that is auditable by the community, not delegated to an SPO and is delegated to auto abstain for voting.

[The Amaru proposal on-chain and off-chain choices](https://gov.tools/governance_actions/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26#0)  
- Standard withdrawal: A scope owner asks other scope owners for money to be withdrawn from his scope.  
- Contingency withdrawal: A scope owner asks other scope owners to withdraw an amount from the contingency funds.  
- Scope reconciliation: A scope owner asks other scope owners for a change of ownership (or a reallocation of budget).  
- Contingency refund/closing: scope owners ask to send the leftovers from the contingency budget to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.  
- Credential rotation: In case of lost credentials or the departure of a scope owner, a mechanism allows the rotation of credentials to a new scope owner upon approval by all (5 out of 5) PRAGMA members (effectively capturing PRAGMA's board decision to appoint new maintainers).  
- Failsafe: In the extreme scenario where credentials would be irremediably lost, thus preventing any further decision, a failsafe mechanism allows all unconsumed funds to be sent back to the Cardano treasury.  
- [The off-chain framework](https://bafkreiabxyva5lfm6zztg7tnktxvvbbucljrce7hlrp4p6hropqzfaip3y.ipfs.dweb.link/) that will be used for every paid contributor on Amaru

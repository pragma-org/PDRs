- PRAGMA board meetings reschedule: some upcoming meetings are during public holidays and events, by default these meetings have been postponed by a day (the day after) and will have to be reviewed to make sure everyone can attend

- PRAGMA as an Administrator: Christina will be meeting with CF's CLO Nicolas Jacquemart in order to clarify the setup required for PRAGMA to become an administrator and receive compensation for it. There are still open questions regarding conflict of interest, who are the resources doing the actual job, how to setup the activity.  
The approach is clear: provide a self assessment to the project that want PRAGMA as an administrator, have a minimalistic set of rules based on the constitution and ask for a fee to setup the administration of funds.  

- New topic: Intersect inviting PRAGMA to be part of the "Intersect oversight committee" included in their smart contract setup for administration of their projects. Topic has been opened by Jack Briggs (Intersect interim executive director) & Christina, topic to be discussed further once the extent of the collaboration is clarified.

- PRAGMA General Assembly ideas turned into goals: after the General Assembly brainstorming about "what added value can PRAGMA bring to the Cardano ecosystem" a few topics were risen but with no concrete timeline and effort required to deliver
A first topic that looks like a quick win is: "Providing mentorship" this can be done in many ways without requiring new resources and be a pragmatic first step in the right direction:
> Use the current General Assembly members to hold open calls and do mentoring on the spot or any other activity (like pair programming) that showcases a way to do things  
> Have the current projects (Aiken & Amaru) hold open coding sessions / open calls on things that are happening on the project

> The main idea is to have a monthly basis schedule with a weekly theme  
> Christina will lead that topic to organise the next steps

- PRAGMA accounting overview: the current balance in the [PRAGMA accounting file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ShML1QATmVPgfHNH9UY-BLXj1PSyYKL2Jo5G17JztGw/edit?usp=drive_link) shows that without taking into account unforseen events there should be enough funds for what is currently planned
> If there was unplanned events that might require additionnal funding Sundae & dcSpark will step up to compensate by paying fees

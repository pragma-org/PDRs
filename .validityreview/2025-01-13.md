* Voting: [PDR 6](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0006-Project-Reporting) (Proposed): Project reporting
* Voting: [PDR 7](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0007-Licensing) (Proposed): Licensing - details to be added, but can be voted as is

## Discussion topics mentionned 

PDR 6 (Project reporting): The "Community changes (last committer addition)" category should be clarified, the initial thought behind this category was to showcase the community aspects of a project (number of stars, bookmarks, new contributors...)  

New roles of board members were chosen:
* Finance: Sebastian Bode [@cleanerm5][]  
* Brand management: Daniel Gonzalez [@gonzalaga][]
* Legal affairs: Federico Weill [@federicoweill][]

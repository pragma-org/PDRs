## Meeting notes

Christina, Aiken Lead maintainer vote: the board voted in favor ([@musik-c]; [@gonzalaga]; [@federicoweill]; [@cleanerm5]; [@grobmeier]) of having [Kasey White](https://github.com/MicroProofs) as Lead maintainer for the Aiken project.

Christina, [post-mortem](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/tree/main/PDR-0009-Post-Mortem) PDR review: comments about this being a Guideline or a Policy, this was settled by making it a Guideline to allow project to not get overwhelmed by administrative activities.  
Back and forth about the scope of application of post-mortems, this should be used to reflect upon situations that are done, success, failures, neutral there's no limit to using this for a learning purpose.  
Final discussion about who should take charge of the "action items & next stops" and how it is tracked, this was defined to be the lead maintainer responsibility to track this with the project team and not necessary to be tracked by the board.

Christina, [maintainer committee](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/pull/25) PDR review: see the content of the pull request for detailed review

Christian, board advisor role: as of today [@grobmeier] won't be continuing his contract with PRAGMA as extrnal board advisor, his last day will be the 30th April 2025

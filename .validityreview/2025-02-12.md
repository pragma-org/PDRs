## Meeting notes

Sebastian, finance: captured all the invoices linked to PRAGMA, synchronised with Wadsack (the service provider for accounting) and created a spreadsheet to track our budget and expenses  
Accounting context: PRAGMA is an association with a turnover under 100k CHF, the next deadline regarding tax statements is in March 2026.

Federico, legal: reviewed the scope of Probst partners (the service provider for legal services) the contract is straightforward with a flat fee
Federico, legal: if we require with PRAGMA any additional service from Probst we should go through a statement of work and create a timesheet and a specific statement of work that goes with the activity

Dan, branding: Applied a template of "Creative brief" to Amaru which introduces the context and the intent of the project for non technical people and have a general outlook of the idea, the problem solving, the challenges of Amaru.  
Dan, branding: discussions about the package behind the creative work to be done for Amaru:
- A logo that we can use to represent the Amaru project 
- A set of illustrations that integrate in the website with a colour palette 
- A set of illustrations (maybe the same as the one for the website) used in the documentation for illustrating our core modules (consensus, modularity, network...)

## 2. Current Status on Directives

### 2.1 Open Source Mentorship

- Aiken project has officially confirmed participation.  
- GA members will rotate as session hosts.  

### 2.2 Field-Tested Documentation
- First document completed: **Amaru Budget Proposal Template**.  
- Second document in progress: **Conflict Resolution Template**.  

### 2.3 Project Committee Ideas
- Proposed creating a **standard report template** with defined parameters for recommended projects to ensure uniformity.  
- Plan to onboard a **first round of new projects**, followed by additional rounds.  
- Emphasized focus on **onboarding new projects** rather than just existing member projects.  
- Clarification needed on how committee members will be selected and define procedure for project selection â€” decision to be made by the Board.

### 2.4 Trademark Decisions
- **Discussion Points:**
  - The GA will weigh in on how trademarks should be managed.  
  - Costs so far: estimated **10,000 CHF per project** (including research, acquisition, and monitoring).  
  - Ongoing monitoring estimated at **~2,000 CHF annually per project**.    
  - Current decision needed for **Aiken** and **Amaru** trademark expansion.  
  - Should reviews/decisions occur **monthly** or at a **6-month interval**?  
  - Exploring different pricing options.  

- **Tasks:**
  - To email GA members about trademark intentions for future projects.  
  - To ask PRINS about alternative options (annual vs. semiannual reviews).  

### 2.5 Additional Considerations
- What else PRAGMA can offer projects beyond trademarks and reputation.  
- Suggested taking calculated risks, including:  
  - PRAGMA offering **administrator services**.  
  - Providing a **PRAGMA certified badge**.  
  - More active role in **assessing ecosystem needs**.  
- Consideration of whether **mentorship alone is enough** to keep members engaged.  
- Cost of lawyers highlighted as an ongoing concern.

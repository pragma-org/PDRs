## Context
<!-- Provide context, explain where the decision came from-->
PRAGMA currently lacks an incident resolution process. While individual contributors and maintainer committees may handle issues as they arise, there is no formalized structure to ensure consistency, transparency, and efficiency in addressing incidents. The absence of a clear process can lead to delays in resolution, miscommunication and an inconsistent approach to similar issues.

## Motivation
<!-- Why it's necessary to make that decision. -->
A well-defined incident resolution process can aid in ensuring the stability and reliability of PRAGMA's projects. By formalizing an incident resolution process, PRAGMA will benefit from a structured approach to handling issues, improving response times and fostering a culture of accountability and of continuous learning.

## Decision
<!-- Clarify the content of the decision by explaining its scope of application with sufficient details to be self-explanatory. -->
PRAGMA will implement the following structured Incident Resolution Process:

## Incident Resolution Process

## How to submit a report

If you believe someone is in immediate physical danger, please call your local emergency number.

You may report a potential violation of the PRAGMA Code of Conduct in writing or in a spoken conversation as indicated below.

### Submit in writing

To report a violation in writing, please email [conduct@pragma.io](mailto:conduct@pragma.io), which goes to the members of the PRAGMA Administrative Board. If you do not want your report to be received by all members of the Administrative Board, either because you want to submit a report anonymously or because one of the Administrative Board members has a conflict of interest, you may send your report directly to any individual member of the Administrative Board.

### Submit in spoken conversation

If you prefer to report the violation in a spoken conversation, you may request a telephone conversation or virtual meeting with an Administrative Board member. In the PRAGMA Discord server, all members of the PRAGMA General Assembly and Administrative Board are identified by Discord Roles. The Discord link is available on [pragma.io](https://pragma.io).

### How to report anonymously

If you desire to submit a report anonymously, please send a message directly to any individual member of our Administrative Board through the PRAGMA Discord server and let them know you would like to submit a Code of Conduct report anonymously. If you submit your report anonymously, that member of the Administrative Board will share the contents of your report with the rest of the Administrative Board, but they will not disclose your identity as the reporter to the other members of the Administrative Board (unless such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable laws or a court order, or to protect you or someone else from imminent danger).

## What information to include in your report

When reporting a potential Code of Conduct violation, please include the following information in your report:

- Names of the people involved (or if names are unknown, use descriptions and any identifying information such as appearance, role, username, or handle), including the person whom you believe violated the Code of Conduct and any witnesses.
- Description of the incident, including the events that occurred, the date and time, and location or community space where the incident occurred.
- The portion(s) of the CoC you believe to be violated.
- If you have relevant documentary evidence, such as screenshots or photographs, please provide those with your report.

## What happens after a report is submitted

### Acknowledgement of Receipt

The Administrative Board will acknowledge receipt of your report in a timely manner, usually within a few business days.

### Who will have access to reports

Reports will only be shared with non-conflicted members of the Administrative Board, with very limited exceptions. See the “Confidentiality,” “Information Sharing,” “Communicating the Results,” and “Conflicts of Interest” sections below for more information.

### Investigation

The Administrative Board will investigate the report by reviewing available evidence and, if appropriate, interviewing witnesses, the accused person, and persons who were targeted or may have been harmed. In some cases, the Administrative Board may engage an external professional investigator or mediator to assist.

If a potential incident comes to the Administrative Board’s attention that may present a serious continuing risk to community safety, the Administrative Board may investigate even if no official report has been received.

If the Administrative Board determines that the Code of Conduct was violated, the Administrative Board will decide on what remediation steps should be taken. See “Resolution” below for more information.

### Notification to the Accused Person

During or after the investigation, the Administrative Board shall notify the accused person that an incident report has been received concerning their alleged behavior, unless the Administrative Board determines that the report is meritless or has been filed in bad faith.

### Resolution

#### Interim Protective Measures

Although the Administrative Board will not take any permanent actions until the Administrative Board has gathered and reviewed all available evidence, the Administrative Board reserves the right to take immediate temporary action (e.g., temporarily suspending someone’s participation in a community space while the investigation is pending) at any time after learning of the incident if the Administrative Board determines this is necessary to protect the community or community members from the risk of harm.

#### Mediation and Resolution by Agreement

If the accused person and the parties potentially harmed in an incident communicate to the Administrative Board that they would like to resolve the incident through restorative conversation, mediation, or mutual agreement, the Administrative Board will wait until the parties have attempted to do so before making any final decisions regarding resolution of the incident.

#### Potential Remedies

The goal of Code of Conduct incident resolution is to support and safeguard the health, safety, and well-being of the community and individuals who participate in the community, and to reinforce community standards for acceptable behavior.

- **Restorative Justice**: Focuses on repairing harm and providing support for all parties involved.
- **Transformative Justice**: Addresses systemic issues that may have contributed to or encouraged harmful behavior.

#### Examples of Remedies

- Issuing a warning
- Removing harmful content from community or project spaces
- A public or private apology
- Temporary suspension or permanent ban from community or project
- Temporary or permanent removal from a leadership role
- Education, mentoring, or coaching
- Addressing systemic issues that contributed to harmful behavior

## Accountability

If any party does not fulfill their obligations related to resolution of the incident, the Administrative Board may take further action to resolve the incident.

## Communicating the Results

An incident is considered “resolved” when the Administrative Board has completed its investigation and determined the necessary remediation actions. The Administrative Board will determine how much information to share with the reporter and the accused person, considering privacy and confidentiality concerns.

## Information Sharing

The PRAGMA Administrative Board and PRAGMA staff may share information with each other on an as-needed basis about reported incidents and their resolution for limited purposes.

## Confidentiality Policy

Only members of the PRAGMA Administrative Board without conflicts of interest will have access to confidential information pertaining to the incident. The Board will not disclose confidential information without permission unless legally required.

## No Retaliation

The PRAGMA community will not tolerate retaliation against community members who report concerns under the CoC in good faith, or who assist in an investigation.

## Conflicts of Interest

### Hard Conflicts

An Administrative Board member has a hard conflict of interest if:

- They are the accused person or a person alleged to be directly harmed.
- They have a close personal or professional relationship with the accused or affected individuals.
- They have another personal interest likely to undermine impartiality.

### Soft Conflicts

A soft conflict exists when:

- The board member works at the same company as the accused person but does not have a close relationship.
- Other circumstances give the appearance of a conflict of interest.

## Amendments

Any amendments to these Incident Resolution Procedures must be approved by the Administrative Board.

## Context

In the statuses of Pragma the board has the responsibility of implementation, management, and oversight of the administration of PRAGMA but no details are mentionned into the decision making process.

## Motivation

The rules behind the decision-making process of the Administrative Board have to be formalised.
THe approach used for this process should be based on a consensus mechanism.

## Decision

The board can only vote on procedural questions related to the foundation, they will use the Pragma Decision Record process to document them. <br>

For every vote made by the board there will be 3 rules to be followed : 
1. The voting will have to take place with a set agenda and the votes will be recorded in the minutes of the meeting by a designated Secretary for the meeting in [.validityreview][Archive];
2. A quorum will be required for the decision making to happen : at least 4 board members have to be present (including the lead administrator);
3. If there's a voting results that ends up with a tie (e.g 2 votes Accepted; 2 votes Rejected) the lead administrator has the power to finalise the decision making;

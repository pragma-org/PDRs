## Context

PRAGMA allows projects to join the association. 
The process of accepting new projects is not formalized in PRAGMA's statutes.
The current process describes, how projects can join PRAGMA at a low entry bar,
when certain conditions are met.

## Motivation

Accepting projects needs rules to ensure that the association's goals are met 
and that the projects are a good fit for PRAGMA. Also, the process should be transparent and fair.
A clear process to accept projects will protect the foundation from potential legal issues.

## Decision

PRAGMA differentiates between two types of projects:

 - PRAGMA Projects: projects that are fully recognized as part of PRAGMA and are part of the PRAGMA GitHub organization.
 - PRAGMA Incubating Projects: projects that are not yet part of PRAGMA but are in the process of joining.
 - PRAGMA Retired projects: projects that are retired from PRAGMA.

This PDR only describes the process of "direct acceptance" of a new project through the board.

### Direct acceptance of new projects

- A project lead can submit a proposal to the board.
- The board will review the proposal and accept the project given the following reasons:
  - The project is aligned with PRAGMA's goals.
  - The source code was developed solely by one or more members of PRAGMA
  - The source code original owners are willing to donate the project to PRAGMA
  - The project is not a fork of an existing project
  - The project does not have any legal issues, such as copyright infringement
  - Trademarks are cleared and the owners are willing to donate them to PRAGMA
  - No other pressing reasons come up during the review
- The board will vote on the resolution through the PDR process and accept or reject the project.

As soon as there is a successful vote on the resolution, the project becomes
an active PRAGMA Project and the transfer can start.

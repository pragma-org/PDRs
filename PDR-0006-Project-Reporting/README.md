## Context

Projects have to report their status to the PRAGMA board regularly.
This proposal is meant to define the report's process and content.

## Contents of a report

A report should contain the following information:

 - Project name
 - Short project description
 - Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)
 - Project status (active, inactive, initiating, etc.)
 - Community changes (last committer addition)
 - Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)
 - Reflection & Performance

## Examples

Examples of board reports can be found here:
https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/

More specifically:
https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Logging_Services.html

## Submission

The reports should be added to the PRAGMA board git repository. 
Reports are due 5 days before the end of a quarter at the latest.

## Discussion points

### Positive outcomes

- Clarity in reporting expectations
- Transparency of PRAGMA projects

### Negative outcomes

- Reporting is additional work for projects

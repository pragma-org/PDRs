## Pragma Decision Record (PDR)

A Pragma Decision Record (PDR) is a formalised decision making document for the Pragma organisation. A PDR describes a change within Pragma processes, a policy for maintainers or a guideline for projects. For more information about what is a PDR and its applications you can check the [Pragma Decision Record process (PDR-0001)](./PDR-0001-Process).

Pragma as an open source organisation intends PDRs to be the primary mechanism for creating processes and managing the rules and the boundaries with its maintainers projects. PDRs are made to document discussions and community inputs towards reaching a decision. PDRs are text files with a versioned repository that will make available the progress of a decision and its discussion.

> **Note** For new PDR, a reference template is available in [.github/PDR-Template.md](.github/PDR-TEMPLATE.md)

## Communication Channels

Extend or discuss â€˜ideasâ€™ in the [Pragma Discord](https://discord.gg/fUyPWjBcKE).

Pragma board members will review discussions in monthly meetings transcribe and summarise them [in the validity review](.validityreview/).

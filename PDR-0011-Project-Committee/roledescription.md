# Project Committee Member

## About the Project Committee

The PRAGMA Project Committee (PC) is a community body that helps evaluate, recommend, and oversee projects joining PRAGMA. The PC ensures alignment with PRAGMA’s mission to advance open source development within the Cardano ecosystem and beyond.

Working closely with the Administrative Board, the committee reviews project proposals, provides guidance projects, and upholds PRAGMA’s values of 
transparency, meritocracy, and collaboration.

## Responsibilities
Project Committee members are expected to:
 - Review and evaluate project applications for technical quality, governance readiness, and community value.
 - Engage with project teams to clarify goals, milestones, and alignment with PRAGMA’s open source principles.
 - Provide recommendations to the Administrative Board on admitting or rejecting project applicants.
 - Offer periodic feedback on active Maintainer Committees and help improve onboarding and reporting practices.
 - Participate in discussions and votes at scheduled PC meetings (typically once per month).
 - Promote collaboration and mentorship across the PRAGMA ecosystem.

## Desired Qualities
We’re looking for individuals who:
 - Have experience in open source software, blockchain development, community management, or governance.
 - Understand (or are eager to learn about) Cardano’s ecosystem.
 - Demonstrate objectivity, discretion, and professionalism in evaluating proposals.
 - Can commit a few hours per month for reviews and coordination.
 - Value collaboration, diversity of thought, and consensus-building.
 - Adherence to PRAGMA's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pragma-org/PDRs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Term and Commitment
   - The Administrative Board issues a public call for applications, describing the role, expected workload and selection criteria. The AB reviews all submissions and appoints members by majority vote.
 - The initial term is 12 months, with the option for renewal.
 - Expected time commitment: 2–4 hours per month (more during evaluation cycles, twice annually).
 - Members may resign in writing at any time.
 - Members may be removed by a majority vote of the AB for cause (misconduct, breach of confidentiality, or repeated non-participation).  

## Benefits
 - Contribute to shaping the growth of open source projects in the Cardano ecosystem.
 - Gain visibility and experience in decentralized governance.
 - Collaborate with diverse technical and governance leaders across the PRAGMA community.

## How to Apply

Interested participants may apply via the official PRAGMA application form (link forthcoming). Applicants should briefly describe:
 - Their background in open source, governance, community management or technical projects.
 - What they hope to contribute to the Project Committee.
 - Any affiliations within Cardano or other open source communities.

## Context

Several roles and responsibilities revolve around the operation of PRAGMA. Over time, it became clear that some of these roles are misunderstood and lack precise definitions. While some roles are relatively well specified in the [statutes](https://pragma.io/statutes/), some others are heavily underspecified.

In particular, we have observed visible confusion around PRAGMA membership and its implications. The distinction between a PRAGMA "project" and a PRAGMA "member" isn't intuitive. In fact, what many people call "member" we call "project."

## Motivation: Why is this PDR necessary?

One of the goals we set during the general assembly meeting in April 2025 is to finalise the value proposition for projects joining PRAGMA. A step towards this includes clarifying what it means to be a PRAGMA project and how it differs from being a PRAGMA member. With clear definitions, we can then hope to build a more solid framework and make clearer the benefits and responsibilities coming with each role.

## Decision

The following document will act as a reference for information regarding PRAGMA actors and roles, in addition to [the statutes](https://pragma.io/statutes). However, it is mainly meant to be a slightly more informal version of the statutes that also covers roles not fully covered by them. In case of conflict, the statutes shall prevail.

### Members

Members of PRAGMA are legal entities forming the supreme and strategic body of PRAGMA. They decide on the strategy, policies and overall operation of PRAGMA. The initial members emerged from an opportune state of affairs: entities with overlapping goals, similar approaches and an appetite to collaborate and share information. Together, members of PRAGMA currently form the _general assembly_ (with a delegate from each entity).

Their role is to shape PRAGMA so that it can deliver its core mission: fostering an open-source blockchain ecosystem for Cardano first and eventually beyond Cardano.

PRAGMA members **MUST**:

- [x] comply at all times with [the Statutes](https://pragma.io/statutes) and any regulations, guidelines, circulars, etc. issued by any body of PRAGMA;
- [x] pay their membership fees;

In exchange, they have the following competencies:

- [x] Approval of the agenda of the general assembly;
- [x] Appointment of scrutineers;
- [x] Admission or expulsion of members;
- [x] Approval of the minutes of the previous general assembly;
- [x] Approval of PRAGMA's strategy;
- [x] Approval of all financial matters of PRAGMA, including, in particular, approval of the yearly budget, financial statements and auditor's report, if applicable;
- [x] Amendment of these Statutes;
- [x] Election and removal of the members of the Administrative Board;
- [x] Decision on the number of seats open on the Administrative Board for their next term of office;
- [x] Creation of maintainer committees upon proposal submitted by the Administrative Board;
- [x] Choice of the services provided by PRAGMA to the [maintainer committees](#maintainer-committees);
- [x] Creation of a [project committee](#project-committee);
- [x] Approval of the activity report for the previous calendar year and approval of planned activities for the next calendar year;
- [x] Approval of proposals submitted by the members;
- [x] Dissolution of PRAGMA and disposal of its assets in accordance with [Article 33](https://pragma.io/statutes#article-33--dissolution-of-the-association).
- [x] Approval of the start of the second phase of the association's vision as per [Article 4 of the Statutes](https://pragma.io/statutes#article-4--vision);

### Project

A project is a collection of files, processes and goals that sit within PRAGMA. A project is managed by a [maintainer-committee](#maintainer-committees). All projects under PRAGMA are fully Open Source and abide by all PRAGMA policies. They may also follow specific guidelines or establish processes of their own. PRAGMA owns all intellectual properties (abbrev. I.P.) of its projects. I.P. includes the source code, the documentation, the specifications, etc. but also the brand and overall project's identity.

By language abuse, we often refer to _projects_ when referring to the _people working on_ a project (i.e. contributors), and we may use those terms interchangeably. Contributors to projects may not necessarily be part of a [maintainer committee](#maintainer-committees).

Projects may also generally "outlive" their maintainer committee in the sense that maintainers may depart from projects from time to time.

While projects may sometimes be born within PRAGMA, it is expected that the majority of them will come from external contributors: teams seeking advice and working on maturing their projects within the framework provided by PRAGMA. Hence, contrary to a now-unfortunately-popular belief, projects **must not** necessarily originate from [PRAGMA members](#members). The role of members is to help define the framework that projects may enjoy and benefit from in order to maximise their open-source value proposition.

### Maintainer committees

PRAGMA projects are run by maintainer committees (one per project). Project committees are appointed by [PRAGMA's administrative board](#administrative-board) to be responsible for the maintenance and development of PRAGMA projects. They may or may not be comprised of employees from PRAGMA members. However, they shall generally be selected amongst the most active and relevant contributors to a project.

As per [the statutes](https://pragma.io/statutes):

- [x] Each maintainer committee has a lead maintainer appointed by the [administrative board](#administrative-board).
- [x] The lead maintainer shall report quarterly to the [administrative board](#administrative board) to provide updates on the project and/or the maintainer committee.
- [x] The lead maintainer appoints the other initial members of the maintainer committee. Thereafter, both the lead and the members of maintainer committees are appointed by co-optation.
- [x] The members of the maintainer committees will procure funding as required for their activities independently of and from outside PRAGMA.
- [x] Maintainer committees shall be fully transparent with third parties about the intended use of the funds, the maintainer committee structure and open source nature of the project, and the rules and limitations imposed by PRAGMA.

It is important to stress the last two points: maintainer committees are responsible for seeking funding for a project and ensuring the administration of those funds (either directly or through a mandated administrator). Maintainer committees may find support within PRAGMA's guidelines, templates, and methodology, as well as projects' past experiences.

### Project committee

A project committee is a yet-to-be-formed body of PRAGMA that will be responsible for vetting and selecting additional maintainer committees. Its mission is to assist the [administrative board](#administrative-board) in appointing maintainer committees to projects. It may be comprised of _natural persons_ coming either from PRAGMA members' internal staff or from external people interested in assisting PRAGMA.

### Administrative Board

The administrative board is the interface between the general assembly and the rest of both PRAGMA and the external world. The general assembly tasks the board with implementing the strategy for PRAGMA. Its role is detailed in [the statutes](https://pragma.io/statutes) as follows:

- [x] Development of strategic direction for PRAGMA, subject to approval by the general assembly;
- [x] Implementation, management, and oversight of the administration of PRAGMA, including:
    - [x] Establishing a policy concerning the use of intellectual property in the association.
    - [x] Interfacing with maintainer committees
    - [x] Organisation of the general assembly and reporting to the general assembly on all activities of PRAGMA;
- [x] Organisation and management of the services provided to members, including selection and appointment of appropriate service providers;
- [x] Management of PRAGMA's financial affairs.
- [x] Upon decision by the general assembly to create a project committee, set up a project committee and appoint its members. The administrative board may also propose new projects and/or suggest the creation of new maintainer committees for the general assembly.
- [x] Upon decision of the general assembly to create one or several maintainer committee(s), appoint the maintainer committee lead(s) for such maintainer committee(s);
- [x] Any matter relating to PRAGMA that the statutes do not assign to any other body.

## Consequences

- The above document shall become a reference point when communicating about PRAGMA's bodies and their roles.
- We shall amend this document (and keep a changelog) as necessary to reflect any changes happening in the future.

## Discussion Points

- We touched about this issue during the GA meeting, and agreed on settling on definitions through a collaborative document.

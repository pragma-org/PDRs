## Context

In PRAGMA's statutes, the board is responsible for implementing, managing, and overseeing PRAGMA's administration of PRAGMA.
The statutes do not mention details in the decision-making process.

## Motivation

The rules behind the decision-making and voting process of the Administrative Board need formalization.
The approach used for this process should be based on a consensus mechanism.

## Decision

The board can only vote on procedural questions related to the association; they will use the PRAGMA Decision Record process to document them.

Each voting must comply with the following rules:

1. The voting will have to take place with a set agenda, and the votes will be recorded in the minutes of the meeting by a designated Secretary for the meeting in [.validityreview][Archive];
2. A quorum will be required for the decision-making to happen: at least four of five board members have to be present
3. If there's a voting result that ends up with a tie (e.g., two votes accepted; two votes rejected), the decision will be postponed to the next meeting, where the absent board member will have to vote;
4. If a board member is absent for more than three consecutive meetings, the board can ask the general assembly to elect a temporary board member who can participate in the voting process. 

## Consequences

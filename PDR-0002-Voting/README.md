## Context

In PRAGMA's statutes, the board is responsible for implementing, managing, and overseeing PRAGMA's administration of PRAGMA.
The statutes do not mention details in the decision-making process.

## Motivation

The rules behind the decision-making and voting process of the Administrative Board need formalization.
The approach used for this process should be based on a consensus mechanism.

## Decision

The board can only vote on procedural questions related to the association; they will use the [PRAGMA Decision Record process](../PDR-0001-Process/README.md) to document them.

Each voting must comply with the following rules:

1. The voting will have to take place with a set agenda, and the votes will be recorded in the minutes of the meeting by a designated Secretary for the meeting in [.validityreview][Archive];
2. A quorum will be required for the decision-making to happen: at least four of five board members have to be present
3. If there's a voting result that ends up with a tie (e.g., two votes accepted; two votes rejected), the decision will be postponed to the next meeting, where the absent board member will have to vote;
4. If a board member is absent for two consecutive meetings, the board can ask the general assembly to elect a temporary board member who can participate in the voting process. 

## Consequences
<!-- Describe the result/consequences of applying that decision; both positive and negative outcomes. -->
<!-- If category is a Policy, describe how to measure the application of the policy on a project (qualitative or quantitative) by using metrics that can be understood by any internet user. -->

### Positive outcomes

- Clarity in decision-making: a public voting process ensures that all board members 
  and interested parties know how decisions are made. 
  This process will reduce confusion and improve governance.
- Transparency: Recording votes and maintaining minutes allow everyone to review the decision-making.
- Consistency: A formalized process helps that decision-making is consistent across different meetings.
- Efficiency: Clear rules for quorum and tie-breaking help to reduce the time on procedural issues.

### Negative outcomes

- More bureaucracy: the voting process may slow down the decision making due to the reliance on meetings.
- Deadlocks: when there is a tie, absent members may cause further delays of important decisions
- Attendance requirement: board members' attendance is more important, especially for the quorum and tie-breaking procedure.
- Temporary board members: temporary board members may lead to inconsistency in decision-making as they may not know all the issues behind the decisions.

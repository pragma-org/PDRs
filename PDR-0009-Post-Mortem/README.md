## Context
PRAGMA is a growing organization that will need to reflect upon it's actions as an organization, project, or representation from it's members. A tool such as a post-mortem will aid in that process.

## Motivation
A post-mortem review is performed to analyze the details of an incident/system failure/end of a project/etc for the purpose of learning from mistakes and to identify opportunties for improvement. Guidelines are needed to aid in this process and to keep the process consistent.

## Decision
The following guidelines should be used to start the post-mortem process, first through documentation and then reflection with the relevant members to assess and further document the leasons to be learned as well as to assign action items. The post-mortem documentation should include:

### Incident Description
```
<!-- Briefly describe what happened, when, and where (e.g., GitHub, Twitter, email). -->
<!-- Summarize the conflict and how it escalated. -->
```

### Root Cause Analysis
```
<!-- Identify the reasons for the dispute (e.g., miscomm, unclear governance, personal differences). -->
<!-- Highlight any systemic issues (e.g., lack of a clear dispute resolution process). -->
```

### Resolution
```
<!-- Explain how the situation was resolved (e.g., mediation, new repository owners). -->
<!-- Outline any compromises made. -->
```

### Impact Assessment
```
<!-- Public trust: Did the dispute harm PRAGMAâ€™s reputation? -->
<!-- Internal team: Were other members affected? -->
<!-- Project continuity: Did it delay development or cause forks? -->
```

### Lessons Learned
```
<!-- What could have been done to prevent the incident? -->
<!-- Are there any governance gaps that need addressing? -->
<!-- What preventative improvements could be implemented? -->
```

### Action Items & Next Steps
```
<!-- Any new policies or processes (e.g., better repo ownership policies, clearer comm channels) -->
<!-- Training or guidelines for conflict resolution/de-escalation. -->
<!-- Plans for rebuilding trust with the community. -->
```


## Consequences

### Positive outcomes
The process instills a learning culture and allows us to identify opportunties for improvement that we might otherwise miss. 

### Negative outcomes
The process may require additional effort from members to document post-mortems.
It's possible disagreements could rise regarding past decisions, requiring careful handling.

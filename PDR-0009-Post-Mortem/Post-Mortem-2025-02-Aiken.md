## Incident Description
<!-- Briefly describe what happened, when, and where (e.g., GitHub, Twitter, email). -->
<!-- Summarize the conflict and how it escalated. -->
Personalities clashed between two developers, one who previously reported to another then left to work for what some perceive 
to be a competitor. A post was removed on Discord, being cited as spam - no visual complaints were observed regarding the post. 
The poster was offended and escalated to removing the developer (who had removed the Discord post) from his administrative access to 
the open source project. This further escalated in aggressive back and forth tweets that were very visible to the community.

## Root Cause Analysis
<!-- Identify reasons for the dispute (e.g., miscomm, unclear governance, personal differences). -->
<!-- Highlight any systemic issues (e.g., lack of a clear dispute resolution process). -->
Unresolved personal differences went unspoken for too long where one interaction was the proverbial last straw. It should be 
noted that the Admin Board (AB) does not have a dispute resolution process at this time.

## Resolution
<!-- Explain how the situation was resolved (e.g., mediation, new repository owners). -->
<!-- Outline any compromises made. -->
This issue was resolved by calm cool heads coordinating from multiple sides. The day of the Discord event, one member of the 
General Assembly (GA) reached out to the offended party. The only motivation was to have an open line of communication with 
someone who was disgruntled. By the second day the Twitter posts began escalating. The same GA member engaged with the 
offended party while an AB member engaged with VPs at Cardano Foundation. The resounding message was everyone stand down. 
While this happened, members of InputOutput also encouraged the offended party to stand down. The combination allowed him to 
reflect and ultimately turn over administrative access to two GA members he felt he could trust, while walking them through 
removing his own admin access. This was voluntary.

## Impact Assessment
<!-- Public trust: Did the dispute harm PRAGMAâ€™s reputation? -->
<!-- Internal team: Were other members affected? -->
<!-- Project continuity: Did it delay development or cause forks? -->
For a brief period of time a single maintainer had sole admin access over the repo/site/etc. There was no impact to the code 
or development. No team members were harmed. The public impact was minimal, the issue was resolved quickly. 

## Lessons Learned
<!-- What could have been done to prevent the incident? -->
<!-- Are there any process gaps that need addressing? -->
<!-- What preventative improvements could be implemented? -->
Should projects be required to hand over credentials to assets/repos/etc to PRAGMA? This would necessitate the creation of an 
entity to oversee these. Discuss something like Bitwarden/cost? <br>
Should PRAGMA have a dispute resolution process? <br>
Should we define a base set of rules for our Discord server? Should we use the Code of Conduct we have in Github?

## Action Items & Next Steps
<!-- Any new policies or processes (e.g., better repo ownership policies, clearer comm channels) -->
<!-- Training or guidelines for conflict resolution/de-escalation. -->
<!-- Plans for rebuilding trust with the community. -->
Revisit policies to encapsulate the above lessons learned during next AB and GA meetings. <br>
Who should handle the Aiken Twitter account going forward?

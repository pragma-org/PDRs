# Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors, maintainers and community participants pledge to making participation in 
our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, 
body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by Maintainer Committees.

## Our Standards

The PRAGMA Community is open, inclusive and respectful. Every member of our community 
has the right to have their identity respected.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include but are not limited to:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Putting facts above opinions to reach a decision
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include but are not limited to:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Stalking or following someone without their consent
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

The following behaviors are also prohibited:

* Providing knowingly false or misleading information in connection with a Code of Conduct investigation or otherwise intentionally tampering with an investigation.
* Retaliating against a person because they reported an incident or provided information about an incident as a witness.

## Our Responsibilities

Authors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, 
Maintainer Committees commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying 
these principles. Maintainer Committee members who do not follow or enforce the 
Code of Conduct when made known of violations may be temporarily or permanently 
removed from the committee.

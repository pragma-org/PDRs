## Context

Projects have to report their status to the PRAGMA board on a regular basis.
This proposal is meant to define the process and the content of the reports.

## Contents of a report

A report should contain the following information:

 - Project name
 - Short project description
 - Problems that require board attention (infrastructure, trademarks, etc.)
 - Project status (active, inactive, just getting started...)
 - Community changes (last committer addition)
 - Next planned steps (new releases, big changes, etc.)
 - Open Security issues

## Examples

Example for board reports can be found here:
https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/

More specifically:
https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/Logging_Services.html

## Submission

The reports should be added to the PRAGMA board git repository at least 7 days in advance of the next meeting.
